first repository (testing sample)

People, 
This is the very first time in which I have attempted to learn code this far. This is rather exciting to me. I am sure, as I have now had an opportunity to take a look inside programing, that it is going to be a real comittment on my part to stay focused and learn to master coding altogether. I am excited to begin this journey as it has been a dream of mine to educate myself and learn the language of the unstoppable.
